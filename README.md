# Dashboard_for_HumanResources
This was my assignment for Visualisation Subject in my 3d year of DataScience degree:
- The task was designing a functional and aesthetically correct dashboard.
- The technology used is plotly and flexdashboard in R.
- The idea is to select appropriate color pallete, forms and composition to create a self explanatory dashboard
- I used Human Resources Dataset from Kaggle and my Dashboard could be used by Human Resources managers in order to control and prevent employee attrition.
